# Notes:
# Place commands here that are unique to powershell when run in a ISE shell.
# If you have commands that should run when starting both the console or the ISE shell, but them in profile.ps1
# If you have commands that should run only in the console shell, put them in Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
